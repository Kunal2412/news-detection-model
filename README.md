Here I have built a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. Using sklearn, I have built a TfidfVectorizer on the provided dataset. Then, I have initialised a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix is used for checking the performance of the model.
